\f1\fs20 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. \
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versi-color). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centi-metres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.\
